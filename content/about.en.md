My name is Duken Marga. I pride myself as experienced Structural Engineering with well understanding on seismic design (building and non building: mechanical/architectural). I have solid knowledge of fundamental material mechanics, structural modelling, and numerical analysis.

I have worked for Rekayasa Industri and helped build 2 geothermal power plants (PLTP) and one LNG regasification plant. I also worked for Indokomas Buana Perkasa to helped build 3 electrical substations, 1 factory extension, and 1 international data center. In my early days, I worked as engineering staff at Material and Concrete Lab at Institut Teknologi Bandung. Currently, I'm working on my side project, LinearStep, a web based application to help engineers to design concrete structural elements based on code SNI 2847:2019 (eq. ACI 318M-14).


My areas of expertise include: structural analysis and design, problem solving (engineering and construction), web programming, communication, leadership, continuous learning/development, and resiliency.
